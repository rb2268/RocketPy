# RocketPy Simulations

Simulates airbreaks to model their data.

## Description

I have used the starter code from RocketPy to obtain a 3D model of airbreak's characteristics from sample test data online.
We can get realistic data from simulations or even better, wind tunnels.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* MAC or Windows OS
* Need Python installed
* Need RocketPy installed on whatever code editor you use (I used Thonny) (You could also use VSCODE but probably would have to make a virtual environement)

### Installing

For my setup:
* Install Thonny from the Internet (much more user friendly than using Venv on VSCODE)
* Intall the specific folder needed and make sure all files are kept in the same folder

### Executing program

* Use the Find Folder.py to find the path to all of these files
* More explained within each file
